=== Enemy Count ===

The number of enemies that will be spawned is decided as follows:

If floor == 1:
  1/3 chance for 1 enemy
  1/3 chance for 2 enemies
  1/3 chance for 3 enemies
Else, if floor == 2:
  1/4 chance for 1 enemy
  1/4 chance for 2 enemies
  1/4 chance for 3 enemies
  1/4 chance for 4 enemies
Else, if floor == 3:
  1/5 chance for 1 enemy
  1/5 chance for 2 enemies
  1/5 chance for 3 enemies
  1/5 chance for 4 enemies
  1/5 chance for 5 enemies
Else:
  1/4 chance for 2 enemies
  1/4 chance for 3 enemies
  1/4 chance for 4 enemies
  1/4 chance for 5 enemies

If Pulpy Berry Juice active:
  Reduce enemy_count by 1
If Fresh Veggie & Berry Yogurt Smoothie active:
  Increase enemy_count by 1

If enemy_count under 1:
  enemy_count = 1
If enemy_count over 5:
  enemy_count = 5

=== Horde and Chain Checks ===

This section only applies if you have already unlocked Horde fights. All of the bonuses described here are only active when the boss event in Dream Path 1F has been cleared, even the parts pertaining to rare encounters.

Special triggers are checked before looking at the general encounter data, to force a horde encounter or a rare enemy spawn at specific chains. The TL;DR is:

(If the chain is a multiple of 10)
- Guaranteed to face a horde on the 30th battle in a chain
- Guaranteed to NOT face a horde, if specific break item is on
  - This also negates the one on the 30th chain
- Guaranteed to face a horde, if specific break item is on
  - This takes priority over the other break items
  - This is wasted on the 30th battle in a chain since it was already guaranteed
- 50% chance to face a horde on every 10th battle in a chain
  - The remaining 50% chance spawns the rare enemy for that floor

(If the chain is a multiple of 5, but not 10)
- (10 * chain / 5)% chance to spawn the rare enemy for that floor
  - This is not affected by break items

(Otherwise)
- Break items that increase horde chance give 1% chance each to face a horde at any time

And the code, as presented in the x86 assembly. The tangle of ifs and elses is so insane that Ghidra messed up the decompilation and I had to run this by hand:

If chain is a multiple of 10 AND larger than 0 AND Horde boss cleared:
  horde_chance = 50
  If chain is 30:
    horde_chance = 100
  If Orange Marmalade Jam active:
    horde_chance = 0
  If Vanilla Lemon Curd active:
    horde_chance = 0
  If Fruit Basket active:
    horde_chance = 100
    Decrement break item counter by 1
  If Mango Bouquet active:
    horde_chance = 100
    Decrement break item counter by 1
  If (horde_chance)% check passes:
    Spawns the horde for this floor
    Skips every other check in the function
  Else:
    Spawns the rare enemy for this floor
Else:
  If (Fruit Basket OR Mango Bouquet active) AND chain is not a multiple of 5 AND Horde boss cleared:
    horde_chance = 0
    If Fruit Basket active:
      horde_chance = horde_chance + 1
    If Mango Bouquet active:
      horde_chance = horde_chance + 1
    If (horde_chance)% check passes:
      Spawns the horde for this floor
      Skips every other check in the function
  If chain is a multiple of 5 AND larger than 0 AND Horde boss cleared AND didn't spawn a horde:
    rare_chance = 10 * chain / 5
    If (rare_chance)% check passes:
      Spawns the rare enemy for this floor

=== ???????? ===

This seems to be unused right now, since the chain requirement is massive and the enemy IDs don't correspond to anything in the available enemy portraits in the game data. It's some weird code that might attempt to spawn some ultra rare enemy and force you to face against 5 enemies. The enemy IDs have dummy stats associated with them.

chain_factor = min(chain * 10 + 100, 2500)
event_chance = chain_factor / 100
If (event_chance)% check passes:
  Try 100 times to:
    Generate random enemy slot 1-5 (20% chance each)
    If it's vacant:
      Spawn dummy enemy ID 5997 / 5998 (50% chance each)
      enemy_count = 5
      Stop trying to do this

=== Tile Proximity Checks ===

The game forces an enemy to spawn if you are close enough to specific tiles in the map. Each tile is associated with an enemy (or no enemy at all), and the game runs a random check to see if the enemy related to that tile gets spawned or not, following the steps below:

For each tile up to 3 distance away:
  If any proximity check passes:
    spawn_chance = weight / (distance + 1)
    If (spawn_chance)% check passes:
      Spawn the enemy associated with tile
  If number of spawned enemies >= enemy_count:
    Skips every other check in the function

Distance here means adding up your absolute X and Y offsets, so that only the cardinals are 1 tile away, and diagonals are 2 tiles away. Makes sense since you can't walk diagonally in this game. The order tiles are checked in goes as follows:

[Distance 0]
- Tile you are stepping on

[Distance 1]
- Tile to your right (X + 1)
- Tile to your left (X - 1)
- Tile under you (Y + 1)
- Tile above you (Y - 1)

[Distance 2]
- Cardinal tiles in the same order as distance 1 (East -> West -> South -> North)
- Bottom-right diagonal
- Top-left diagonal
- Top-right diagonal
- Bottom-left diagonal

[Distance 3]
- Cardinal tiles in the same order as distance 1 (East -> West -> South -> North)
- Just follow the diagram:
   -
  4-8
 2---5
---#---
 6---1
  7-3
   -

Funny trivia, the game actually checks all 25 possible tiles manually in the order described instead of writing a loop. Below are the associated weights, tiles and enemies for each floor. Each tile has a different triggering distance, with some triggering only if you're above them, and some going up to 3 tiles away:

  Seed of Forgetfulness - 100

Checking for tiles 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 23 and 24 in 1F is pointless as it does not have them in the map

> Forest of Oblivion 3F

For some unknown reason, some tile IDs in this floor are completely whack. I have no idea why, and am referencing the raw map data to extract the data below. Blessed shall be the one that tries to defy this unholy curse.

=== Global Encounter Weights ===

The break items that boost rare enemy encounter chances only apply to the weights below, not to the boosts described above. They are also currently bugged since they do not check the correct enemy IDs when assessing if a monster is rare or not: it currently checks if ID is between 600 and 700, when it should be 5000 and 6000.

Those items also stack additively, not multiplicatively - they work by adding the weights a second time (or two times, for the one that triples the odds), and so when both are active, you just add the weight 3 times more to the base one, 4x'ing the weight rather than 6x'ing it.

These weights should be added together, and then odds of any given enemy spawning is the ratio between its weight and the sum of all applicable weights. That's how it went with the second game, but I didn't see this particular code this time around. The structure is the same so it's likely how it's done, but I couldn't find confirmation:
